This was the master thesis project carried oout at [**Regelungstechnik, TU Dortmund**](https://rst.etit.tu-dortmund.de/) and at the (then) department of KI und Autonome system, [**Fraunhofer IML**](https://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/). This was a solo thesis research carrried out under the supervision of [**Prof. Dr. Frank Hoffmann**](https://rst.etit.tu-dortmund.de/lehrstuhl/team/hoffmann/) and [**Phd, Mr. Julian Eßer**](https://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/abteilungen/b1/informationslogistik_und_assistenzsysteme/team_digitalisierung/unser-team-digitalisierung/julian-esser.html).
The thesis is highly novel in terms of research methodology where the concept of hierarchy is used in the end to end learning of robot navigation which is further extended to loco-manipulation. The image below represents the  [**evoBOT**](https://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/en/fields_of_activity/material-flow-systems/iot-and-embedded-systems/evobot.html) in my Deep Reinforcment learning based pipelin in Nvidia GPU and simulation Isaac sim. This work was part of OmniIsaacGymEnvs(IsaacLAb). The goal of the thesis was to make a fully autonomous solution where the evoBOT learns to pick and place an object from one point to another point using only IMU onboard sensor with no vision data. This marks a highly unique and novel research experiment as the robot itself is a highly complex dynamics difficult to model. Further more the researcg explores on the Hierarchy concept of two policies of low and high level neural networks to accomplish the goal.
