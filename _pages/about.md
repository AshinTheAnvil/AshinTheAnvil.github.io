Ashin — Robotics Engineer

With a Master’s in Automation & Robotics from [**TU Dortmund**](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/) and a Bachelor’s in Robotics & Automation from [**PSG College of Technology**](https://www.psgtech.edu/), I’m a robotics engineer who gets things done. My work at [**Fraunhofer IML**](https://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/) involved deploying deep reinforcement learning on evoBOT, while at [**Vodafone GmbH**](https://www.vodafone.de/), I tackled digital twins and Sim2Real challenges with Boston Dynamics’ Spot and Unitree’s humanoid robots.

My master’s thesis on hierarchical reinforcement learning for agile loco-manipulation, completed in partnership with Fraunhofer IML, reflects my focus on pushing robot learning into real-world applications. Early on, my bachelor’s thesis — done with IIT Delhi — explored simulation and control of robot manipulators in PyBullet, laying a technical foundation.

Since childhood, I’ve been driven to mimic and improve human tasks through robotics, cutting down errors and making everyday life smarter.
When I’m not building robots, I’m diving into PC gaming — mainly RPGs and action-adventure titles like Cyberpunk 2077, GTA, Baldur’s Gate 3, Elden Ring and plenty more.

I’m currently seeking an entry-level position as an AI Robotics Engineer or Robotics Engineer, ready to bring my skills to the front lines of innovation.
